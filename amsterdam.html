				Two days weekend gateway started on Friday afternoon from Buxtehude,Hamburg. Buxtehude to Amsterdam is around 450km which we covered in 5 hours approx by road. We reached Amsterdam at around 8 in the evening and headed to the city direcly. Amsterdam is famous for its canals and bycyles is the best way to cover them , However we parked our car and walked to the city center.Also since we had a car we were staying in a hotel which is quite far (around 5 to 7 km ) from the city center (Hotels in Amsterdam is super expensive and the best way is to stay out of city if possible or take hostels).	</p>
			<p>
				On the same night we had covered Dam Square which is one of the most iconic locations of amsterdam which was built in remembrance of those who died during World War II. Resting well in the night after a long drive and a city walk since we had to cover Muiderslot castle- Surrounded by water and gardens and constructed over 700 years ago, on the next day.
			</p>
			<p>
				Started from hotel around 8 to Muiden Castle which is around 15 kilometers southeast of Amsterdam, it is often named as Amsterdam castle and is worth visiting once , Dont forget to grab audio guides to listen to the histry which takes you to Middle Ages. Post visting catle was time to grab a lunch and why not some chinees ? We headed to a chinees restarant near Diemen which was also in the direction of Amsterdam. After chilling a while there , We headed again back to amsterdam for a city walk.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ever since reading "The Diary of a Young Girl" by Anne Frank, it was a dream come true to vist Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, however we were not able to get in since the tickts has to be purchased online, Unfortunate though. But managed to click some good pictures over there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also Today would be technically last day of this trip in amsterdam as we planned to cover Utrecht the next day.  This probably was the most unfortunate day of all since weather was a bit rash , it was raining by the time we reached Utrecht , around 1 in the afternoon. However we did manage to cover the city driving slowly around the canals , the city was really beautiful , especially during this period of the year. After spening some time grabbing a quick lunch and driving around Utrecht we headed back to Hamburg.
			</p>

			<p>	
				Amsterdam was a great surprise to me and I'm sure this wont be the last time I visit you :)
